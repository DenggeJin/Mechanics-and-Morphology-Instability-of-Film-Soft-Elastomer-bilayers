# Mechanics-and-Morphology-Instability-of-Film-Soft-Elastomer-bilayers

This is a collection of examples of Abaqus input files used to simulate the morphology instability
(wrinkling, period doubling, ridge formation, second wrinkling, periodic ridge formation, ect.) of film/soft elastomer bi-layer system, including pseudo-dynamic method and static force method. The details about these two method please refer to the paper by Lihua Jin & J.W.Hutchinson.
